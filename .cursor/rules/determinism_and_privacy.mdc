- Core behavior must be deterministic.
  - Same parameters + seed → same maze and same PDF output.
  - Randomness is allowed only via an explicit, seeded RNG.

- Avoid non-determinism unless explicitly approved in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.
  - Do not use time-based, environment-based, or OS-specific randomness.
  - Output must not vary by machine, locale, or run timing.

- Validation must be deterministic.
  - Solver results must be reproducible for the same seed and parameters.
  - A maze that passes once must pass again on re-run.

- Privacy is local-first and offline.
  - No network calls at runtime.
  - No telemetry, analytics, or external logging.

- No persistence by default.
  - Do not store user inputs, seeds, or generated mazes.
  - Any new persistence must be minimal, local, configurable, and documented in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

- No identifiers.
  - Do not create or store user, device, or session identifiers.
  - PDF output must not embed identifying metadata.

- Logging is allowed for debugging only.
  - Console logging is acceptable.
  - Do not write logs to disk unless explicitly approved.

- When correctness is uncertain:
  - Do not guess or fabricate output.
  - Log internally and fail safely (regenerate or surface a single inline error).
