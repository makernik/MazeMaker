description: "Non-trivial work requires a saved plan following the canonical template"
alwaysApply: true

- For any non-trivial change, create/update a plan in `.cursor/plans/` (saved to workspace).
- Plans must follow the structure in `.cursor/plans/_template.plan.md`.
- Required sections: Status, Checkpoints, Validation.
- Default execution is incremental: complete one checkpoint per run unless explicitly requested otherwise.
