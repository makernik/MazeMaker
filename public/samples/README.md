# Sample preview images (unused)

**Deprecated.** Preview now uses a **live canvas** (one maze generated from current level + style). This folder and static PNGs are no longer used by the app.

**Legacy naming** (for reference only): `{ageRange}-{mazeStyle}.png` — e.g. `4-5-classic.png`, `18plus-organic.png`. Style was formerly called "rounded", now "classic". See DECISIONS D-011 (superseded by D-012) and **docs/Unused.md**.
